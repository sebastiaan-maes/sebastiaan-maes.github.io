I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp and a visting postdoctoral researcher at Aix-Marseille University. My research is funded by a fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO). I obtained my PhD from KU Leuven.

My primary research interests are public economics and (applied) microeconometrics, with a strong focus on demand and welfare analysis and social interactions.

I am also interested in the application of novel econometric techniques to questions in economic history.
