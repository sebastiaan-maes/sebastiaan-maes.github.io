<p align="justify">My primary research interests are <b>(applied) microeconometrics</b> and <b>public economics</b>, with a strong focus on demand and welfare analysis and social interactions.</p>

<p align="justify">I am also interested in the application of novel econometric techniques to questions in <b>economic history</b>.</p>
